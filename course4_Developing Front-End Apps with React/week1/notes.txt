What is React? 
- framework for building client-side dynamic web apps.
- Javascript library for building UI's
- special markup languages called JSX.

Intro to FE frameworks and React
- FE frameworks are used to create a dynamic client that can connect to the server.
- made available through open source library
- Angular, Vue and React.

Angular
- Open source from Google
- based on html and JS
- uses directives to make html dynamic

Vue
- open source
- uses virtual DOM
- lightweight and fast

React
- used for building client-side dynamic web apps
- use data binding and virtual DOM

JSX
- resembles html
- can be compiled and interpreted as JS by babel
- embeded inside specail script tags

Important Packages
- react: components, states and props
- reactDOM: glue between react and DOM
- babel: compiles and interprete JSX

Using FE JS frameworks (experts viewpoints)
 
Introduction to ES6 (EcmaScript6)
- Ecma: creates wide range of global info and comm. tech standards
 
 JS ES6 new feature
 let, const, arrow functions, promise, class

 let and const
 - let: restricts the scope of variables within a block where it is declared
 - const: allows declaration of variables whose values cannot be changed.

Arrow functions - allowed functions to be declared as variables. Can be passed as parameters for callbacks

Promise: onejcts that rep the eventualcompletion of an asynchronous operations and its return value.

Intro to TypeScript
**All Javascript is TypeScript, but not all TypeScript is Javascript**
In TypeScript, once a variable type is defined, ut cannot be changed. Variables are static in TypeScript.
* JSX needs a compiler to translate the JSX into Javascript, and Babel is a popular compilare for JSX.

Introduciton to JSX
JSX - Javascript Syntax Extension of Javascript XML:
- it is an extension of Javascript
- creates UI components in react easily
- produces react elements

Introduciton To Components 
Components are:
- core building blocks fo React
- pieces of the UI which can be broken and merged into a parent vomponent to form the final UI

state - an object that describes the behavior of a component.

React component can be stateful or stateless
stateful - class type
stateless - function type.
