cloning - creates a copy of a repo on local machine
forking - modifies or extends a project: takes a copy of github repo to use as the base of a new project

git fetch - gets updates from remote repo to local
git push - takes changes from local repo to remote
git pull =  git fetch + git merge

origin - refers to fork
upstream - refers to original work (cloned or forked repo)

git fetch upstream - grab upstream branches
git merge upstream/master - merge changes into master branch

Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.

Repositories can be cloned to make it possible to work locally, then sync changes back to the original.

Repositories can be forked to be used as a base for a new project, or so that the developer can work independently.

A Pull Request (PR) can be submitted to have your changes reviewed and merged.

Large projects include people working in different roles:

Developer – creates code

Integrator – manages changes made by developers

Repository Administrator – configures and maintains access to the repository
